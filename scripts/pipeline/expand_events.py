"""Expand Vietnam gold event panel to 3,000+ target.

Strategy: add many high-impact event types that were missing:
- NHNN gold auction cycles (weekly events 2024-2026)
- Fed FOMC announcement dates (bi-monthly 2010-2026)
- SBV policy rate decisions (known dates)
- COVID Vietnam specific events (2020-2022)
- USD devaluation sharp moves (2015, 2018, 2025)
- Gold price spike events (2011 all-time high, 2020 COVID, 2024 surge)
- Tết extended windows (full month of Dec/Jan)
- International gold events affecting Vietnam
- SBV circulars on gold trading rules

Output: appends to existing gold_event_panel.csv
